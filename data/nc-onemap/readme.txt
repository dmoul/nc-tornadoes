Summary

NCDOT City Boundaries

This map service is provided by NC Department of Transportation and represents Municipal Boundaries defined through the Powell Bill 2020.

This data was created to assist governmental agencies and others in making resource management decisions through use of a Geographic Information System. Municipal boundaries are recognized as a base cartographic layer for location analysis.  The data are current for fiscal year 2019-2020.

These Municipal Boundaries data are based on the Powell Bill Program maps for the 2019-2020 fiscal year. Municipalities in North Carolina that participate in the Powell Bill Program are required to submit to NCDOT on a regular basis. These data include incorporated municipalities in North Carolina that participate in the Powell Bill Program. Boundaries of municipalities which do not participate in the Powell Bill Program are also included in this data. Sources for the boundaries vary in scale and format as provided by the Municipalities.

This data is updated annually; usually in February.

These data are maintained by the Data Conversion Group of the North Carolina Department of Transportation - GIS Unit. Refer to the metadata for this dataset for more information.
